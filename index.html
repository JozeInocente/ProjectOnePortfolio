        <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>

        <p>Hello! My name is Joze Inocente, and I’m currently in my final year at SFSU. I’m a Visual Media Design major and have been designing for about 8 years now. Started in high school by taking a few classes on digital media, and quickly got attached to the idea of graphic design. I slowly self taught myself how to use applications like Photoshop and Sony Vegas through various YouTube videos, and once I was good enough, and confident enough in my skills I began taking a few freelance jobs through social media. <br>

            The freelance work allowed me to sharpen my skills further and challenge myself. I learned a lot about how to find clients, market myself, and speak to clients. I built a decent portfolio from this work and then stopped taking in commissions in order to focus on college and earn my degree. Taking VMD classes has taught me a lot as well, I learned to use more applications like Illustrator, how to create invoices, creative briefs, how to present my work, and a more detailed understanding of the industry. <br>
            
            Aside from design I also acquired an interest in video editing and computer tech. I edit videos here and there purely for fun and fix or build computers as my current job while I attend school. I also enjoy playing video games in my free time, which is also the main focus for my “Top Fives”. I also like watching movies, some of my favorites are “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, “Blade Runner 2049”, and “Spider-Man 2”, just to name a few. <br>
        
            This is my first time creating a webpage with multiple taps through HTML. It was quite the challenge since I’m not a fan of coding but ultimately a pretty satisfying achievement. I made the background in Sony Vegas and it’s meant to resemble the aesthetic of a game called “Cyberpunk 2077”. Thank you for visiting my site!
