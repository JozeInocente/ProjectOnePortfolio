<h1>These are some of the artists that inspire me:</h1>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/soviet_logos/?hl=en"> <h3><em>Soviet Logos</em></h3> </a>

<p>
    <h4>Soviet Logos is an Instagram page I found recently and their work has helped me a lot with finding inspiration for my own work. Their aesthetic and focus on simplicity also resonates with how I like my own design work to look like.</h4>

<p>
    <h4>Andrew Prahlow is a musician I discovered through a video game called "Outer Wilds", and have been listening to their music for about 3 years now, I find their music to be comforting and perfect to listen in the background while working on other things.</h4>

    <h4>Alasdair Willson is a motion graphics designer I don't know very much about but I do admire their work a lot, the old school mecha anime aesthetic and cyberpunk themes really resonate with me.</h4>
